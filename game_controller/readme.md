## Getting the parts
Aside from the 3D printed equipment and printed circuit boards, the parts required to build the controller can be obtained from two suppliers; [McMaster-Carr](http://mcmaster.com) and [Digikey](http://digikey.com). It is most likely possible to find other sources fot the components, but the part numbers given here are for these two suppliers. The manufacturers names and part numbers are also given when available. The numbers given represent the bare minimum required to build the controller. Getting spares of everything is highly recommended.
