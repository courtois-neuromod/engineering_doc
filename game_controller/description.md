### Enclosure
The enclosure for the controller is the part that will be held by the participant inside the MR scanner. It has to be free of any metallic/electronic part. It was designed using Autodesk Fusion 360, basing the model on the general shape of different commercially available controllers. All parts were 3D printed using an Ultimaker 3 printer with PLA filament.  
The top and bottom parts of the casing are held together with commercially available Nylon 6/6 threaded inserts and polycarbonate screws.

### Switch mechanism
The sensing mechanism for all controls is made of 2 optical fibers of 10 m length going from the electronics interface in the scanner control room to the enclosure inside the scanner and back. Inside the enclosure, the transmitting and receiving fibers are aligned by insertion in a switch module and positioned facing each other leaving a 0.8 mm air gap. When a button is pressed, a small shutter blade moves down to block the light going through and the optical receiver module located in the control room triggers a digital input on the microcontroller.

## Silicone membranes
Use sharp Xacto knife to cut free the silicone dome used to push the keys upward after a keystroke. Carefully cut away the center of the top part to leave hole for shutter.

## Assembly

### Controller
1. For each control on the controller, cut one length of duplex fiber optic to desired length between controller and interface module + 150 mm
2. Split each length of fiber on its length to separate the 2 fibers on a distance of approx. 750 mm from one end, and 25 mm from second end
3. Label each fiber with the name of matching control. On the end where the fibers are split for the largest distance (controller end) place a label on each single fiber
4. On the controller side of the fibers, make two bundles of fibers. Place one fiber of each control in either bundle.
5. For one of the two bundles, cut the fibers for the directional pad controls about 150 mm shorter than the ones for the buttons. Do the opposite with the other bundle. This will allow a cleaner layout of the fibers inside the casing.
6. Strip and polish fibers **(need procedure)**
7. Cut two 500 mm lengths of the 13 mm ID plastic hose and fix those on the ends of the Y splitter
8. Fix second end of plastic hoses to extrusions on part *Casing_Bottom*

9. For each control, place a *Switch_Body* in matching groove inside casing.

10. Insert the fiber optics into Y splitter and push gently until both fibers emerge inside of casing. The bundle where the buttons fibers are longer will go on the directional pad side. There will be one fiber for each control in each branch of the Y. Make sure that the length protruding inside the casing is enough to reach into the corresponding *Switch_Module* and allow to lay out cleanly inside casing.
11. For each control, glue both fibers in place **(Need glue specs)**
12. Optional: Depending on fit tightness of *Switch_Module* parts inside grooves, it is also possible to glue the module in place. If gluing modules in place, wait for glue on fibers to set before proceeding
13. Place one threaded Nylon insert in each mounting post of part *Casing_Top*. If inserts don't fit inside, re-drill hole using 1/4" (6.35 mm) bit. If inserts are loose, use a drop of cyanoacrylate adhesive
